    <h2>Kapitel 1 JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL</h2>

    <p> 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late.
        Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could
        walk through the streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as
        near the correct time as possible. The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East;
        the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the
        traditions of Turkish rule. It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a very
        interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier—for the Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina—it has
        had a very stormy existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series of great fires took
        place, which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it
        underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine
        and disease. </p>

    <p>He went, but immediately returned with a letter:—

        “My Friend.—Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow
        the diligence will start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo Pass my carriage will await
        you and will bring you to me. I trust that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you will
        enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.

        “Your friend,
        “Dracula.”</p>

    <p>4 May.—I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count, directing him to secure the best place on the
        coach for me; but on making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and pretended that he could not
        understand my German. This could not be true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he
        answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old lady who had received me, looked at each
        other in a frightened sort of way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that was all he
        knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife
        crossed themselves, and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak further. It was so near
        the time of starting that I had no time to ask any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means
        comforting.</p>

    <p>The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in
        rosy light. With one impulse the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest “Amen” broke from all as their
        eyes followed the pointing of his finger. The dying man spoke:—

        “Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is not more stainless than her forehead! The
        curse has passed away!”

        And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a gallant gentleman.</p>
